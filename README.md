# Current Status
The mod is still in development, but is nearly ready for an alpha release. To keep up to date, join the "UNBEATABLE (PC)" thread in `#future-game-design` in the [Archipelago discord server](https://discord.gg/8Z65BR2).

# What is this?
[Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) is a multi-world, multi-game randomizer. That means it takes items from number of different games played by different people, randomizes their locations, and combines them into one big multiplayer randomizer.

This implementation brings UNBEATABLE to Archipelago, allowing you to create/join a lobby with any of their [supported games](https://archipelago.gg/games) or [community implementations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iuzDTOAvdoNe8Ne8i461qGNucg5OuEoF-Ikqs8aUQZw/).

When playing UNBEATABLE Arcade Mode while connected to an Archipelago lobby, you'll have a limited song selection which grows as you or your teammates find your song items, and you'll send items to other people by setting scores and gaining in-game rating.

# Installation
An installation guide will be added once the mod is released.

# Other Info
## Developers
An environment setup and build guide will be added once the mod is released and in a more stable development cycle.

## Other Repositories
Releases from multiple repositories from me are bundled with this project. The source code for these is listed below.

The source code for the .apworld (randomizer logic) can be found at [this link](https://github.com/AllPoland/Archipelago/tree/main/worlds/unbeatable_arcade).

This project uses my UI Resources repository, which you can find as a submodule in this repository or at [this link](https://github.com/AllPoland/UNBEATABLE-UI-Resources).
